/**
 * This class implements a disjoint-set data structure.

 * A disjoint-set data structure is a data structure that keeps track of a set
 * of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint (nonoverlapping) subsets. A
 * union-find algorithm is an algorithm that performs two operations on such a
 * data structure:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>Find: determine which subset a particular element is in.</li>
 * <li>Union: Join two subsets into a single subset.</li>
 * </ul>
